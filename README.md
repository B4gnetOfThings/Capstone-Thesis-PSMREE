Overall mean is 15.43 KW. Refrigeration, lightning and ventilation are top energy consuming categories. Most MSMEs operate within a low energy intensity range, however, there are some few outliers from different sectors or business category that needs further enhancement. Sunday has the lesser usage and Fridays has the most. Operating hours are not a good indicator of energy consumption. Through a structured awareness intervention, the study also revealed improved understanding and adoption of energy-efficient practices, particularly in relation to renewable energy. The assessment of energy efficiency practices highlighted strong applicability in areas such as LED lighting, behavioral changes, and energy-efficient appliances, presenting immediate opportunities for improvement. Based on their calculated daily energy consumption, tailored solar PV setups were recommended, with most businesses falling within the 1 to 6 kW system range. Higher-capacity systems (above 20 kW) were not encouraged to pursue standalone setups due to cost and storage limitations. Battery storage remains essential for off-grid reliability but is economically viable primarily for small to mid-sized installations. Single line diagram grid tie setup is provided as recommendation
