# Energy Profiling and Efficiency Enhancement of Selected Micro-Small-Medium Enterprise in Ilocos Norte, Philippines


## Abstract
This study looked at the daily operations‚Äô energy consumption patterns, assessed corporate operators' energy awareness, and suggested doable plans for cutting use and improving efficiency of MSMEs in Ilocos Norte. By not only identifying areas in need of improvement but also arming MSMEs with the required knowledge to adopt sustainable practices inside their operations. The study demonstrates that with the right knowledge and tools, MSMEs can significantly reduce operational costs and enhance sustainability. Findings support the formulation of localized energy interventions and policies that empower MSMEs to contribute to broader renewable energy and climate goals.


## üìå **Purpose of this Repository**

This repository serves as a **documentation of the journey behind the data analysis** conducted for my manuscript:

> *[‚ÄúEnergy Profiling and Efficiency Enhancement of Selected Micro-Small-Medium Enterprises in Ilocos Norte, Philippines.‚Äù](/ENERGY PROFILING AND EFFICIENCY ENHANCEMENT OF SELECTED MICRO-SMALL-MEDIUM ENTERPRISE IN ILOCOS NORTE, PHILIPPINES.pdf)*

It includes structured notebooks that outline:

- The **storylines of data cleaning, analysis, and visualization**,  
- Insights that informed the manuscript‚Äôs results and discussions, and  
- The process of developing recommendations for MSME energy efficiency and renewable energy adoption.

By sharing this, I aim to provide transparency in my analytical workflow, support reproducibility, and serve as a resource for other researchers working on energy profiling, MSME development, or renewable energy feasibility studies.
